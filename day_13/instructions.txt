Mos ","t of the mirrors seem to be aligned in a consistent way; perhaps you should head in that direction?","As you move through  ","the valley of mirrors, you find that several of them have fallen from the large metal frames keeping them in place. The  ","mirrors are extremely flat and shiny, and many of the fallen mirrors have lodged into the ash at strange angles. Because "," the terrain is all one color, it's hard to tell where it's safe to walk or where you're about to run into a mirror.","You "," note down the patterns of ash (.) and rocks (#) that you see as you walk (your puzzle input); perhaps by carefully anal ","yzing these patterns, you can figure out where the mirrors are!","For example:","#.##..##.","..#.##.#.","##......#","##......#","..#.##.#.","..##..##.","#.#.##.#.","","#...##..#","#....#..#","..##..###","#####.##.","#####.##.","..##..###","#....#..#","","To find the reflectio ","n in each pattern, you need to find a perfect reflection across either a horizontal line between two rows or across a ve ","rtical line between two columns.","In the first pattern, the reflection is across a vertical line between two columns; arr ","ows on each of the two columns point at the line between the columns:","123456789","    ><   ","#.##..##.","..#.##.#.","##......#"," ","##......#","..#.##.#.","..##..##.","#.#.##.#.","    ><   ","123456789","","In this pattern, the line of reflection is the vertical lin ","e between columns 5 and 6.
